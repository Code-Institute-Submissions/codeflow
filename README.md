After creating the basic project I chose to improve the project organisation by turning the application into a package with `__init__.py` and moving the routes to `views.py`. to avoid confusion I renamed `app.py` to `run.py` to be different from the package name. At the same time I created a `requirements.txt` to be inclusive of choice for other developers or the assessors.
